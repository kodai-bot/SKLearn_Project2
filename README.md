# SKLearn_Project2
 Project_2_Big_Data_Analytics
Hi, the main.py file runs the code. 
There is one main in the directory above that is the first half of the project on SKLearn and one in the MLEnsemble folder in which the models are trained and visualised. The example models are commented out and a Gradient Descent model is used instaed.
